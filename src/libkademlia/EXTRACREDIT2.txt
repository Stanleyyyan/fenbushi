For extra credits:
1: For TestIterativeFindNode: 
	In this test we test IterativeFindNode function 
2: For TestIterativeFindNodeFail:
	In this test we also test IterativeFindNode function, and in this test we design the tree that make the target node cannot be found
3: For TestIterativeStore:
	In this test we test DoIterativeStore function, and check if the key/value is successfully store in the nodes in shortlist
4: For TestIterativeFindValue:
	In this test we test IterativeFindValue function
5: For TestIterativeFindValueFail:
	In this test we also test IterativeFindValue function, and in this test we check when value is not stored, whether the closest node's ID is returned
